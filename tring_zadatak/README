This program does:

1) Sets LED1 on for every even and off for every odd second.
2) Sets LED2 on for summer and off for winter time counting (Daylight Saving)
3) On demand changes RTC (Clock/Calendar)
4) Automaticaly configures itself for Daylight saving.

PRINCIPLE:
I used RTC alarm so send alarm interrupt every second. In interrupt handler
to toggle LED1 I used LSB of RTC Clock register, so we are sure that LED1 is
always on for even and off for odd seconds. That way we don't need any calibration
between RTC clock and timer because RTC gererates interrrupts by itself.
In the same interrupt handler we check for daylight saving change by just comparing 
two variables, which represent date/time of DLS chage, with current date/time and in
case of such change we call needed routines to change the RTC.
